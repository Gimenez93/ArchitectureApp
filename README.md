SpringMVC-HTML
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rogargon/springmvc-html.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rogargon/springmvc-html)

This is a simple Spring demo of a Greetings application.

It uses SpringMVC and provides a RESTFul API but just based on an HTML user interface.
 
More advanced versions of the demo also feature JSON APIs (not yet available).
